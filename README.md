### ThreeJS
As a volunteer, I collaborated with a colleague on visualizing a custom 3D object (a GoPro camera model) using the ThreeJS JavaScript library. We connected it to a Python backend, which captures angle changes on the model via a gyroscope and projects them onto the frontend in a web browser. This results in real-time adjustments to the object's position.
I only have the front-end part of the project's code available.
